          <p class="paragraph">We collect the following types of information about you when you use the Site and/or Applications:</p>
          <ul class="list"> 
            <li>Information provided by you. We collect personally identifiable information, such as your name and email address, when you register to become a member and if otherwise requested by the Site or an Application.

          <ul class="list"> 
            <li>We will display your personally identifiable information on your profile according to the preferences you set. We will use your name so that you are recognizable on our database and so that we can personalize your experience.

            <li>We may use the information collected automatically, such as your IP address, information stored via cookies, and information about how you use the Site and/or Applications to develop statistics and aggregate information about the number of people who visit the Site and to customize the Site and/or Applications. We may share this information with third parties to help us improve our service and better serve our users.</li>
            <li>We use an outside company to serve advertisements on our site. In the process of serving advertisements, cookies are placed in your browser’s cookie file and may use information, such as IP addresses but excluding your name, address, email address or telephone number, about your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements on this site and other Web sites about goods and services that may be of interest to you. By delivering ads on the Site, our ad serving vendor is able to record what ads a user — identified by the unique cookie — has seen, and what pages on the Site the user was viewing when the ads were delivered. This Web usage information is combined with other ad delivery information (e.g., what type of operating system your computer uses) collected from your visits to the Site and other sites not affiliated with Slots Say. This non-personally identifiable information is used as part of the ad serving process for reporting and to select and direct the ads you see online at the Site and other sites not affiliated with Slots Say. Unlike the cookies Slots Say uses in other parts of our site, cookies received with banner ads are collected by our ad serving vendor and we do not have access to this information. Additionally, some ads served are generated by other third party ad serving systems that also may place a cookie or transparent GIF files on your browser to provide web usage information to those third parties.</li>
            <li>We may provide your personally identifiable information and the data generated by cookies and the aggregate information to the vendors and service agencies that we may engage to assist us in providing our services to you. Such third party entities will be obligated to use your personally identifiable information solely to provide the services to us.</li>
            <li>Personally identifiable information about you, including the contents of your online communications, may be accessed or disclosed in response to legal process (for example, a court order, search warrant or subpoena); in other circumstances in which we believe, in our sole discretion, that the Site or the Application is being used in the commission of a crime; when we have a good faith belief that there is an emergency that poses a threat to the safety of you or another person; or when necessary either to protect our rights or property, or for us to render the service you have requested.</li>
            <li>Personally identifiable information collected in connection with your use of the Site or the Applications may be stored in any country where we or our service providers maintain facilities.</li>
            <li>If a user elects to use our referral service for informing a friend about our site or particular features or content, we ask them for the friend’s name and email address. We will automatically send the friend a one-time email inviting them to visit the Site. We store this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email.</li>
            <li>We maintain archives of our web logs, database, and other systems and information. Please note that it is possible some of this information may remain archived after we delete the information from our active database. We also may maintain archives for disaster recovery, legal and other non-marketing purposes.</li>
            <li>We reserve the right to transfer your personally identifiable information in the event of a transfer of ownership of Slots Say, such as acquisition by or merger with another company.</li>
